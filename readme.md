## Description
This is a simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator prompts the user to input two numbers and an operation choice, performs the calculation, and displays the result.

## Features
- Addition of two numbers
- Subtraction of one number from another
- Multiplication of two numbers
- Division of one number by another, with error handling for division by zero

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codewithvishaldk/CALCULATOR-mydailywork.git
   cd simple-calculator
   ```

2. **Open the project in your preferred IDE**:
   - Open Visual Studio Code or any other IDE.
   - Navigate to the project directory.

## Usage

1. Open the terminal in your IDE or your system's command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the calculator script:

   ```

## Code Overview

### `calculator.py`

This is the main script for the calculator application. It includes:
- **add(x, y)**: Function to add two numbers.
- **subtract(x, y)**: Function to subtract the second number from the first.
- **multiply(x, y)**: Function to multiply two numbers.
- **divide(x, y)**: Function to divide the first number by the second, with error handling for division by zero.
- **calculator()**: Main function that prompts the user for input, performs the selected operation, and displays the result. It also handles invalid inputs and allows multiple calculations.

## Example

When you run the application, you will be prompted to:
- Select an operation by entering the corresponding number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, 4 for division).
- Enter two numbers for the calculation.
- The application will display the result and ask if you want to perform another calculation.
