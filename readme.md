## Features
- Addition of two numbers
- Subtraction of one number from another
- Multiplication of two numbers
- Division of one number by another, with error handling for division by zero

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codewithvishaldk/CALCULATOR-mydailywork.git
   cd simple-calculator
   ```

2. **Open the project in your preferred IDE**:
   - Open Visual Studio Code or any other IDE.
   - Navigate to the project directory.

## Usage

1. Open the terminal in your IDE or your system's command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the calculator script:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

## Code Overview

### `calculator.py`

This is the main script for the calculator application. It includes:
- **add(x, y)**: Function to add two numbers.
- **subtract(x, y)**: Function to subtract the second number from the first.
- **multiply(x, y)**: Function to multiply two numbers.
- **divide(x, y)**: Function to divide the first number by the second, with error handling for division by zero.
- **calculator()**: Main function that prompts the user for input, performs the selected operation, and displays the result. It also handles invalid inputs and allows multiple calculations.

## Example

When you run the application, you will be prompted to:
- Select an operation by entering the corresponding number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, 4 for division).
- Enter two numbers for the calculation.
- The application will display the result and ask if you want to perform another calculation.
